# Student Result Dashboard — Dark Purple Theme (UI Only)

This is a **frontend-only** React + Vite project (UI design only) for a Student Result Management dashboard.
It uses Tailwind CSS and static/mock data. No backend is included.

## Quick start

1. Extract the project:
   - If you downloaded the ZIP, unzip it.
2. In project root run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open the Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- This is a design mock — forms and actions show alerts and operate on mock data.
- To connect to a backend, replace mock data with API calls (axios or fetch).
